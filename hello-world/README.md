# Hello World Tutorial

Welcome to VibeArena! This tutorial teaches you how to use the coding challenge system.

## Your Coding Environment

Click "Start Challenge" and VibeArena spins up an isolated sandbox with:
- Full VS Code editor in your browser
- Terminal with all tools pre-installed
- AI coding agents ready to use

No installation required—everything runs in the browser.

## Important Notes

- The `tests/` directory contains test files that verify your solution. **Do not modify these files.**
- Your solution will also be evaluated against hidden tests, so make sure your code handles edge cases correctly.
- Run `pytest` in the terminal to test your solution at any time.

## Your Task

Fix the syntax error in `hello.py` so that it prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Expected Output

When you run `python hello.py`, it should output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## How to Test

**Option 1: Use the Test Button (Recommended)**
Click the "Run Tests" button in the VibeArena UI. This runs the test suite and shows you the results directly in the browser.

**Option 2: Run Tests Manually**
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

If all tests pass, your solution is correct!
